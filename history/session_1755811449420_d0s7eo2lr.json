Digital and Emerging Skills  \n \nThe green economy is increasingly data -driven, and a new suite of digital skills is \nbecoming essential for optimizing processes, improving monitoring, and driving \ninnovation.  \n\u25cf Energy and Environmental Modelling:  Proficiency in specialized software is a \nkey differentiator. This includes energy modeling software  like PVSyst for solar \ndesign 112, \nthermodynamic modeling  for energy efficiency analysis 78, and software for \nconducting  \nLife Cycle Assessments (LCAs)  of products and processes.  \n\u25cf Geographic Information Systems (GIS):  GIS skills are critical across multiple \nsectors for spatial planning and analysis. This includes site selection for \nrenewable energy projects, mapping biodiversity hotspots for conservation \nplanning, and planning urban green infrastructure.  \n\u25cf Data Analysis and Remote Sensing:  The ability to analyze large datasets from \nenvironmental monitoring is becoming crucial. This includes interpreting data \nfrom remote sensors, drones, and satellite imagery for applications such as \nmonitoring deforestation, assessing crop health, and tracking air or water \npollution.  \n\u25cf Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Grids:  In the energy and water sectors, \nskills related to IoT are emerging.
