      "Hair braiding falls primarily within the Orange Economy, representing creative and cultural work. To grow your business or transition, consider these options:\n\n*   **Formalize Your Skills:** Seek training in cosmetology or hairstyling. While you currently practice informally, formal training can provide you with certifications to improve your services and potentially open a formal salon.\n*   **Leverage Digital Platforms:** Use online platforms to promote your services, connect with clients, and learn new techniques [3].\n*   **Explore Related Creative Industries:** Consider other areas within the Orange Economy that align with your skills, such as fashion design, makeup artistry, or content creation related to beauty and style [7].\n*   **Understand the Market:** Research current trends and client preferences to adapt your services and stay competitive.\n\nBy building on your existing skills and exploring new opportunities, you can expand your career within the creative sector.\n"
