      "To study architecture in Gauteng universities, it's important to check the specific entry requirements for each institution, as they may vary slightly. Generally, architecture falls within the Iron and Platinum Economies, requiring a **Skilled** educational background.\n\nHere's what you should typically consider:\n\n*   **Academic Qualifications:** You'll need a strong performance in your secondary school leaving certificate (e.g., National Senior Certificate). Specific subject requirements often include Mathematics and Physical Science, but this can vary [5].\n*   **Specific University Requirements:** Each university in Gauteng (like the University of Pretoria, University of the Witwatersrand, or the University of Johannesburg) will have its own specific admission criteria, including minimum APS (Admission Point Score) [5]. Check their websites for the most up-to-date details.\n*   **Portfolio:** Some architecture programs may require you to submit a portfolio of your creative work [5]. This demonstrates your artistic and design abilities.\n*   **Application Process:** Apply through the Central Applications Office (CAO) or directly to the university, depending on their procedures [5]. Be sure to meet all deadlines.\n*   **Undergraduate Prerequisites**: It is important to meet the undergraduate admission prerequisites before applying for architecture programs [5].\n"
