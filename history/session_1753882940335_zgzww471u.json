      "Hello! I understand you're looking for career guidance, specifically through the lens of the Refracted Economies Framework (REF). To give you the most relevant advice, could you tell me more about what you're interested in? For example, are you curious about specific industries, skills, or job roles? Are you based in a particular African country?\n\nTo illustrate how I can help, let's imagine you're interested in becoming a software developer in Kenya.\n\n*   **REF Color-Coding:** Software development primarily falls within the **Platinum Economy**, which represents technology and innovation [1]. This is because software developers are involved in creating new technologies, applications, and systems.\n*   **Characteristics Matrix:**\n    *   **Skill/Knowledge:** Highly **Skilled** and **Knowledge**-based.\n    *   **Adaptability/Innovation:** **Elastic** due to the constant evolution of technology, and highly **Entrepreneurial** or **Imitative**, depending on whether you're creating new software or adapting existing solutions.\n    *   **Organizational/Social:** Can be **Formal** (working for a company) or **Informal** (freelancing), **Private** (working for a tech company) or **Public** (developing government software), **Individual** (working alone on projects) or **Collective** (part of a development team), and **Permanent** (employee) or **Gig** (contractor) [2].\n    *   **Sustainability/Values:** Can be **Sustainable** if the software addresses environmental or social issues, and can be very **Meaningful** depending on the application.\n\nFor instance, if you are developing Agri-Tech solutions, you would be working at the intersection of the Platinum (Tech) and Bronze (Agriculture) economies, combining technological innovation with traditional farming practices [5].\n\nOnce you provide me with more specific information about your interests, I can offer a more tailored analysis using the REF.\n"
